# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression

This project builds and evaluates a logistic regression model to classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — using four features: **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

The classic [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) is used, and the notebook includes detailed steps from loading the dataset to evaluating the trained model's accuracy.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given measurements of sepal and petal dimensions, predict the species of an iris flower. This is a **multiclass classification** problem with three output classes.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy & Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, train-test split, metrics)

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Data Loading:** Using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Viewing feature distributions and species breakdown
- **Train-Test Split:** Splitting into training and testing data
- **Model Training:** Logistic regression using `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
- **Visualization:** Pair plots and predicted labels comparison

## 🧪 Results

- The logistic regression model achieves over **95% accuracy** on the test set.
- Confusion matrix and classification report show strong performance across all three classes.
